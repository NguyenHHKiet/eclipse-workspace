What is a Stream?
- an abstraction
- focuses on the all instead of the parts
- imperative to functional programming
- used with collections

How to use Java Streams?
1 - Start with a collection
	array
	set
	list
	map

2 - list.stream()
	-> stream	-> stream	-> stream
	filter		map			reduce
(intermediate operators)

3 -  back to concrete
	list
	int
	object
	optional
	string
sum(), collect(Collections.toList()) -> terminal operators
, average(), collect(Collections.groupingBy()) -> terminal operators
